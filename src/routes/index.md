- Entry-based, business-oriented data definitions (no need for relational modeling and physical RDBMS table structure).
- Entries are extensible by meta-data and arbitrary attachments
- Entries and attachments can involve structured, unstructured and binary data
- Entry changes are tracked for auditing and review : Who, when and what
- Entries are represented using file-based Json that is optionally schema-enabled
- Operational store that can be reconstructed from the file-based data.
